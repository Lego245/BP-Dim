# *Welcome to Beyond Planets - Dimensions Git* #

This is a mod for Minecraft that adds dimensions to an original mod called Beyond Earth.

The core mod adds the blocks, but does not attach it to a dimension. This is where this mod comes into play. The core is more of a very early access to this mod.
